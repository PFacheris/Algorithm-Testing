Algorithm Testing
================================

NxN-Dimensional-Array-Operations:
Matrix computation test in Ruby.
Implements matrix multiplication on multidimensional arrays using the classical method and Strassen's Algorithm.
*Only works for N=2^s dimensional arrays.

Polynomial Derivative Approximation:
Shaw-Traub Algorithm test for evaluating n normalized derivatives of a polynomial declared by an input file.
Input file should have degree of polynomial on first line, coefficients on second, and a real number that the derivative will be at on the third.
